ðŸŽµ Discord Auto-Play Bot
This is a simple Discord bot built with discord.py that automatically connects to a voice channel on startup and plays a specified MP3 file at a set interval (cooldown). The bot also includes a command to leave the voice channel.

ðŸ“‹ Features
Automatically connects to a specified voice channel when the bot starts.

ðŸ§  Usage
Once the bot is running:

It will auto-connect to the designated voice channel and begin playback.

It replays the MP3 file every COOLDOWN seconds if the file isn't currently playing.

Use the !salir command in any text channel the bot can read to make it leave the voice channel.

ðŸ“Œ Notes
Make sure FFmpeg is installed and working. You can download it from: https://ffmpeg.org/

The bot currently plays a local .mp3 file only. You can extend it to stream URLs or support playlists.

This script is meant for small personal servers. Consider using a proper queue/music handling library for larger implementations.
